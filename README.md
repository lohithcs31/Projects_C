## 📦 Projects Included

Each folder contains an independent project with its own source code, documentation (where applicable), and build instructions:

### 📁 Address_Book
A command-line based address book application built in C.

**Key Features:**
- Add, search, edit, and delete contacts
- Persistent file storage
- Structured modular code

For full details, see the `README.md` inside the **Address_Book** directory.

### 📁 Steganography
Implementation of **LSB Image Steganography** that supports both **encoding** and **decoding** processes.

**Steganography Highlights:**
- Hide secret text inside a `.bmp` image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique
- Retrieve (decode) the hidden message from the stego image
- Uses bit-level manipulation and file I/O in C

For full details, see the `README.md` inside the **Steganography** directory.
